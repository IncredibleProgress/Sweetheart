# [Sweetheart 0.1.3]()
*innovative foundations for enterprise-grade solutions*

## A supercharged heart for the non-expert hands

What about security, big-data, realtime databases, responsive interfaces and AI? Sweetheart comes with the highest quality components widely used by the GAFAM and others, also the best coding practices, and makes the hard stuff for you. Start from scratch, and create with ease and efficiency the apps you really need embedding reliable open source code for processing your data at full power!

Since Ubuntu operating system can be used in any cloud services and as usual software within Windows 10/11, it provides an incredible way for any organization to develop, deploy, and administrate powerful responsive apps including AI keeping high capabilities of integration with the already existing tools like databases, MS-Excel, or SAP.

Sweetheart provides a Python/React centric approach leading you implementing best components and best practices. Due to the top-rated place of the Python language regarding to data processing, calculations and AI, this makes sweetheart a fast and ideal toolkit for innovative ideas.

Sweetheart is shared under the [CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT](http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-C_V1-en.html).

## Get at rocket speed full benefits of coding, including AI

Sweetheart supports you getting coding full power from scratch :

  - easy to learn, easy to use
  - quick and clean prototyping
  - quick and clean deployment

  - made for calculations, big-data and AI
  - made for high performances and innovation

It comes too with some pragmatic intentions at its heart :

  - no commercial dependencies are required or needed in the basement
  - a lot can be done with a reasonable coding effort, which is the prime intention

## Stick to worldwide best practices without thinking about it

Sweetheart is a thin-layer for going efficient and doesn't reinvent the wheel. It will transform you stepwise in a good driver and maybe in a pilot! Due to provided high quality components, a hardened configuration and the included documentation you will **learn to make great apps with Python and React** including up-to-date best practices and patterns. You won't learn Sweetheart itself, you will learn Python/React real coding-life like any other developer, but skipping some tedious considerations. That means especially you don't need any kind of expertise to use good things in the right way. Be quite, sweetheart is made for low resources consumption, high security level, and best performances :

  - it ensures code reliability and maintainability
  - it ensures an enterprise-grade security level

## Rely on rock-solid pillars keeping innovative capabilities

Sweetheart offers hardenest coding approach for new development projects. Reason is: it integrates the well known causes of programs failures and dysfunctions. Many coding technologies are great, I sincerely encourage for using it, today you can innovate only making code, but I will discourage you to implement it into a company without fixing a fine-tuned frame, which provides enough guaranties.

### why your programs will fail ?

  - underlying C/C++ libraries raise memory leaks
  - invalid values are given silently to functions
  - network protocols are not properly implemented
  - code is written with a poor logic and a poor readability
  - no reliable strategy exists related to the code dependencies
  - maintenance & security concerns are not considered enough

### why Sweetheart supports you ?

#### Maintenance & security are the 1st concerns

Maintenance and security topics are underlayed into Sweetheart. You don't need really to care about it, just be trained enough, use provided reference documents, and be aware for adopting some good habits, e.g. testing your apps. This allows you making coding efficiently being focused on your buisiness topics only. The rest is a matter for experts working hard for providing Sweetheart!

#### Open-source dependencies strategy is included

Sweetheart manages dependencies and sourcing, making most relevant choices for firstly building the buisiness apps you need, and secondly processing data without technical limitations, AI area included. Dependencies can be splitted in 3 separated categories of open-source solutions as follow. 

##### 1/ Rely on most valuable open-source technologies
###### Ubuntu Server - Nginx - Postgres - Rust - Python

  - most adopted, observed, and studied technologies
  - major technologies, managed by top-rated organizations
  - clear objectives and strategy, advisable for long-term solutions

##### 2/ Use highly valuable open-source solutions
###### Typescript - React - TailwindCss - Pydantic - Pandas ...

  - widely adopted, observed, and studied libraries
  - recognized solutions, managed by established organizations
  - predictable objectives and strategy, advisable for middle-term solutions at least 

##### 3/ Integrate some of the most brillant open-source initiatives
###### NginxUnit - SolidJS - RethinkDB

  - innovative, breaking, and emerging ideas
  - superlative design and code quality
  - adopted by recognized people and organizations
  - but needs to be followed and supported for long-term solutions
