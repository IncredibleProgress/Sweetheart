# [Sweetheart 0.1.3](https://super-duper-sniffle-wx944ppqvq42997-1234.app.github.dev)
*innovative foundations for enterprise-grade solutions*

## A supercharged heart for the non-expert hands

What about security, big-data, real-time databases, responsive interfaces and AI? Sweetheart comes with the highest quality components widely used by the GAFAM and others, also the best coding practices, and makes the hard stuff for you. Start from scratch, and create with ease and efficiency the apps you really need embedding reliable open-source code for processing at full power your data!

Since Ubuntu operating system can be used in any cloud services and as usual software within Windows 10/11, it provides an incredible way for any organization to develop, deploy, and administrate powerful responsive apps including AI keeping high capabilities of integration with the already existing tools like databases, MS-Excel, or SAP.

Sweetheart implements a Python/React centric approach leading you implementing best components and best practices. Due to the top-rated place of the Python language regarding to data processing, calculations and AI, this makes sweetheart a fast and ideal toolkit for innovative ideas.

## Get full benefits of coding, including AI

Sweetheart supports you getting coding full power from scratch :

  - easy to learn, easy to use
  - quick and clean prototyping
  - quick and clean deployment
  - made for maintainable great code quality
  - made for calculations, big-data and AI
  - made for high performances and innovation

no commercial dependencies are required or needed for using it,
and it comes too with some others pragmatic intentions :

  - it introduces a consistent way for making dev within company
  - it provides up-to-date and top-rated capabilities, ready-to-use
  - it intends at its heart to cover specific needs of the industry
  - it keeps simple dev integration into company's change strategies
  - it encourages the "1 knowledge package that covers all" idea


## Stick to worldwide best practices without thinking about it

Sweetheart is a thin-layer for going efficient and doesn't reinvent the wheel. It will transform you stepwise in a good driver and maybe in a pilot! Due to provided high quality components, a hardened configuration and the included documentation you will **learn at rocket speed to make great apps with Python and React** including up-to-date best practices and patterns. You won't learn Sweetheart itself, you will learn Python/React real coding-life like any other developer, but skipping some tedious considerations. That means especially you don't need any kind of expertise to use good things in the right way. Be quite, Sweetheart is made for low resources consumption, high security level, and best performances :

  - it ensures code reliability and maintainability
  - it ensures an enterprise-grade security level
  - it ensures ruggedness of the committed libraries
  - it ensures the efficiency of your coding effort
  - it allows you to operate without cloud services

## Rely on rock-solid pillars keeping innovative capabilities

### Committed into application

Core resources : **Python - React - Typescript - TailwindCss**

Depending of needs, *low-code* and *no-code* components for dedicated concerns can be built or provided.

### Committed into basement

Core resources : **Ubuntu - NginxUnit - Rust - RethinkDB**

#### why RethinkDB should be used in businesses ?

Maybe some of you can be surprised with regards to RethinkDB, because this not the best known database server. Believe it will become one of these within next years. Sweetheart intends to provide a NoSQL and JSON-based database for performances and versatility purposes. In comparison RethinkDB won't support big binaries like for example MongoDB can do, but this is not a concern for considered enterprise solutions here. On the other hand collaborative work between people must be considered at the highest level in any enterprise and organization. Meaning that working together on same data using several devices has to be the normal way, not a big challenge. Usually implementing real-time capabilities on database systems is technically sophisticated. Because originally the involved technologies were not made for such expectations. RethinkDB is designed for it. Furthermore the admin interface is great, the queries made with ReQL are great, there is no need of any ORM, and no SQL injection attacks risk exists.

### Long term strategy

Sweetheart is born for coding with some overarching considerations which are summarized within the [Zen of Sweetheart](https://github.com/IncredibleProgress/Sweetheart/blob/main/documentation/Zen%20of%20Sweetheart.md).
