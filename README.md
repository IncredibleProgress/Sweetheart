*innovative foundations for enterprise-grade solutions*

## A supercharged heart for the non-expert hands

What about security, big-data, realtime databases, responsive interfaces and AI? Sweetheart comes with the highest quality components widely used by the GAFAM and others, also the best coding practices, and makes the hard stuff for you. Start from scratch, and create with ease and efficiency the apps you really need embedding reliable open source code for processing your data at full power!

Since Ubuntu operating system can be used in any cloud services and as usual software within Windows 10/11, it provides an incredible way for any organization to develop, deploy, and administrate powerful responsive apps including AI keeping high capabilities of integration with the already existing tools like databases, MS-Excel, or SAP.

Sweetheart provides a Python/React centric approach leading you implementing best components and best practices. Due to the top-rated place of the Python language regarding to data processing, calculations and AI, this makes sweetheart a fast and ideal toolkit for innovative ideas.

## Rely on rock-solid pillars keeping innovative capabilities

### Committed into application

Core resources : **Python - React - Typescript - TailwindCss**

For specific needs e.g. in the industry, *low-code* and *no-code* components for dedicated concerns will be built and provided on the core basis.

### Committed into basement

Core resources : **Ubuntu - NginxUnit - Rust - RethinkDB - Jupyter**

#### why RethinkDB should be used in businesses ?

Maybe some of you can be surprised with regards to RethinkDB, because this not the best known database server. Believe it will become one of these within next years. Sweetheart intends to provide a NoSQL and JSON-based database for performances and versatility purposes. In comparison RethinkDB won't support big binaries like some others can do, but this is not a concern for considered enterprise solutions here. On the other hand collaborative work between people must be considered at the highest level in any enterprise and organization. Meaning that working together on same data using several devices has to be the normal way, not a big challenge. Usually implementing realtime capabilities on database systems is technically sophisticated. Because originally the involved technologies were not made for such expectations. RethinkDB is designed for it. Furthermore the admin interface is great, the queries made with ReQL are great, there is no need of any ORM, and no SQL injection attacks risk exists.
