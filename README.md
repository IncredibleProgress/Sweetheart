      Sweetheart is full stack featured and reduces drastically
          the volume of code and committed libraries in your projects.

Sweetheart offers hardenest coding approach for new development projects. Reason is: it integrates the well known causes of programs failures and dysfunctions. Many coding technologies are great, I sincerely encourage for using it, today you can innovate only making code, but I will discourage you to implement it into a company without fixing a fine-tuned frame and methods providing enough guaranties.

### why programs fail ?

  - underlying C/C++ libraries raise memory leaks
  - invalid values are given silently to functions
  - network protocols are not properly implemented
  - code is written with a poor logic and a poor readability
  - no reliable strategy exists related to the code dependencies
  - maintenance & security concerns are not considered enough

### why Sweetheart supports you ?

#### 0% waste of time, 100% focus on business results

Sweetheart is a full stack solution including all needed components for building business-grade apps. It allows you to avoid integrating many libraries by yourself, wasting time with boring topics, and keep you focused on your business topics only.

#### Maintenance & security are the 1st concerns

Maintenance and security topics are integrated within Sweetheart. You don't need really to care about it, just be trained enough, use provided reference documents, and be aware for adopting some good habits, e.g. testing your apps. This allows you making coding efficiently being focused on your business topics only. The rest is a matter for experts working hard for providing Sweetheart!

#### Open-source dependencies strategy is included

Sweetheart manages dependencies and sourcing, making most relevant choices for firstly building the business apps you need, and secondly processing data without technical limitations, AI area included. Dependencies can be split in 3 separated categories of open-source solutions as follow. 

##### 1/ Rely on most valuable open-source technologies
e.g. Ubuntu Server - Vault - Postgres - Rust - Python - TypeScript
  - most adopted, observed, and studied technologies
  - major technologies, managed by top-rated organizations
  - clear objectives and strategy, advisable for long-term solutions

##### 2/ Use highly valuable open-source solutions
e.g. Snapd - Caddy - React - TailwindCss - Pydantic - Pandas ...
  - widely adopted, observed, and studied libraries
  - recognized solutions, managed by established organizations
  - predictable objectives and strategy, advisable at least for middle-term solutions

##### 3/ Integrate some of the most brillant open-source initiatives
e.g. NginxUnit - Gel/EdgeQL - SolidJS
  - innovative, breaking, and emerging ideas
  - superlative design and code quality
  - adopted by recognized people and organizations
  - but needs to be followed and supported for long-term solutions
