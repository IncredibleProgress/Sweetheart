# Zen of Sweetheart

## Basic Rules

* Simple things are always preferable
* Minimalism is one step ahead simple things
* Complicated means you didn't catch your topic
* Code must be always readable and written for others
* Use extra libraries only if not reasonable without

## Security Rules

* The less code, the better
* Only the forever maintained libraries are fine
* Security topics for your projects must be learned
* Code must be tested and its qualities must be evaluated

## Life Rules

* Adopt good habits, read, work hard
* Face challenges and stay enthusiastic
* Be with the others and for the others
* Consider sweetheart as the key of all ;-)
