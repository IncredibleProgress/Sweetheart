# Zen of Sweetheart

## Basic Concerns

* Simple things are always preferable
* Minimalism is one step ahead simple things
* Complicated means you didn't catch your topic
* Code must be always readable and written for others
* Document well what could be not obvious for others
* Use extra libraries only if not reasonable without

## Security Concerns

* The less code to maintain, the better
* Only the forever maintained libraries are fine
* Security topics for your projects must be learned
* Code must be tested and its qualities must be evaluated

## Life Concerns

* Adopt good habits, read, work hard
* Facing issues, being enthusiastic
* Think with the others and for the others
* Remember, sweetheart is a key to many matters ;-)
